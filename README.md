# PredictionBox

Welcome to PredictionBox, a dynamic machine learning sandbox tailored for data enthusiasts, researchers, and students. PredictionBox offers a user-friendly platform to upload data and generate sample predictions using various machine learning models. Enhance your data analysis experience with custom model parameter settings and in-depth learning about each model.

# Key Features


**Upload Your Data:** Easily upload your dataset and get ready to apply machine learning models. Sample data is also available.

**Model Selection**: Choose from a range of models including K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and LASSO.

**Customize Model Parameters**: Tailor the parameters of each model to suit your specific data analysis needs.

**Learn and Explore**: Get insights into each model with detailed descriptions


# Technologies Used


 **Frontend**: Developed with React, offering a responsive and interactive user interface.
 
  **API Gateway**: Utilizes NestJS for efficient handling of requests between the frontend and the machine learning engine.
  
  **Machine Learning Engine**: Powered by Python with the SciKit Learn library, known for its robustness and wide range of machine learning models. The Engine API has been developed using the Django framework.

# Coming Soon


**Support for Additional Models:** Expanding beyond KNN to include a wider range of machine learning models.

**User Registration and Management:** Soon, you'll be able to create your account, save datasets, and keep track of your predictions.

**Issue Board**: Stay updated with our progress through a dedicated issue board. [Link to Issue Board](https://trello.com/b/xGSp2oHT/predictionbox)


Stay tuned for more updates and features! We are committed to making PredictionBox the go-to sandbox for all your machine learning needs.
