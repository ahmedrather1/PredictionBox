  paragraph1:
    "Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. ",
  paragraph2:
    "Imagine you're trying to predict the price of a house (the dependent variable) based on its size, location, number of bedrooms, and age (the independent variables). Multiple Linear Regression helps us understand how each of these factors contributes to the house's price.",
  paragraph3:
    "The method works by finding the equation that best fits the data points available, allowing us to make predictions about the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. For example, it can tell us how much the price is expected to increase for each additional square foot of size or for each year the house is newer.",
  paragraph4:
    "This technique is widely used across various fields such as economics, finance, health sciences, and more, for making informed decisions and predictions based on multiple factors."
