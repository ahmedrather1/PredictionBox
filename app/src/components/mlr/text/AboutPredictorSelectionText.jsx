  paragraph1: " This chart shows the relationship between all the predictors and the response that we're trying to predict. The distance each point is away from 0 indicates how much impact its corresponding predictor has.",
  paragraph2: "Values above 0 suggest a positive influence, and values below 0 suggest a negative influence. The further a point is from 0, the stronger the influence of the predictor.",
  paragraph3: "The error bars between each point show how confident we are in our analysis of the significance of each predictor. Smaller error bars indicate higher confidence.",
  paragraph4: "This visual helps us see at a glance which factors are most important for our predictions.",
