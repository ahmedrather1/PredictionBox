  paragraph1: "Alpha acts as a tuning knob in LASSO Regression.",
  paragraph2: "Increasing its value applies more penalty, leading to smaller coefficients and a simpler model, helping prevent overfitting.",
  paragraph3: "Decreasing alpha reduces the penalty, making the model more complex and similar to Multiple Linear Regression.",
  paragraph3: "If all your coefficients are set to 0, try reducing your alpha!",
  paragraph4: "Adjusting alpha is crucial for striking the right balance between simplicity and accuracy in the model's predictions.",
