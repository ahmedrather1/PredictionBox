  paragraph1: "Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. It aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. ",
  paragraph2: "The equation of the linear relationship is Y = b0 + b1*X. Here, Y represents the dependent variable we're trying to predict or explain, and X is the independent variable we're using to make predictions. b0 and b1 are coefficients representing the y-intercept and the slope of the line, respectively.",
  paragraph3: "Provided Prediction : In this sandbox, you will first see a sample prediction where the values of b0 (intercept) and b1 (slope) have been automatically chosen. This prediction represents the 'best fit' line, calculated based on minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and predicted values. This means, for the given dataset,the provided line represents the most accurate linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables according to the linear regression model.",
  paragraph4: "Intercept (b0): Increasing b0 will shift the line upwards on the graph, without changing its slope. It affects the starting point of the line on the Y-axis. Decreasing b0 will shift the line downwards on the graph, also without altering its slope. It lowers the line's starting point on the Y-axis.",
  paragraph5: "Slope (b1): Increasing b1 will make the line steeper, indicating a stronger positive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It means that for each unit increase in X, the increase in Y becomes more pronounced.",
  paragraph6: "Slope (b1): Decreasing b1 will make the line flatter or even downward sloping if b1 becomes negative. It shows a weaker positive relationship, or even a negative relationship between X and Y, meaning Y increases less with each unit increase in X, or decreases with an increase in X.",
  paragraph7: "Feel free to experiment with different values of b0 and b1 to see how they impact the regression line. Remember, the provided prediction is the statistically determined 'best fit' for the given data."
